# tut-neumorphism-portfolio

A portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
It features a neumorphic design and custom themes

This is not my own work, this was originally created by [The WebShala](https://www.facebook.com/The-WebShala-1094349444089751/)
I followed their tutorial to help my understanding of controlling elements in with css and javascript.
